# TDChallenge

This is a personal challenge project, whose purpose is to validate a file with phones and identify the appropriate area codes for each.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run the program, you will need to install jre at least version 6 onwards and add TDChallenge.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar file to a directory on your local machine, along with a text file with the phone numbers, following the pattern:

```
+351960000000
00351960000000
+00112
```

### Executing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
